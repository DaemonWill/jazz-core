# Jazz Serverless - Seamlessly build, deploy & manage cloud-native applications

Jazz addresses gaps and pain points with serverless, particularly for production applications. Jazz has a beautiful UI designed to let devs quickly self-start and focus on code. Its modular design makes it easy to add new integrations:

* **Services** - Today devs can build functions, APIs and static websites. The template-based system makes it easy to define new ones
* **Targets** - Currently we deploy to AWS Lambda, API gateway and S3. We plan to support Azure Functions and Docker containers in the near future
* **Features** - Services seamlessly integrate features like monitoring, logging, authentication and secret management
* **Deployment & CI/CD** - We leverage [Serverless Framework](http://www.serverless.com) and Git/Artifactory/Jenkins
